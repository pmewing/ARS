# Graphical Interface

This folder consists of a few files that show a representation of what a GUI may
 look like in the future. Only a few menus work in this setup, and the ones that 
 do have virtually no flexibility; this is simply an example interface

The `UI Files` folder contains files that are generated by QT 5 Designer that I
 have used to assist in the creation of this interface.`
